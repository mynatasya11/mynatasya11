I’m B Natasya, 

I am Ph.D. student in the Department of Bioresource Economics at Ehime University Japan. 
My research interest is about how women take decisions in their households and deal with systems in society including decision-making, gender, land use, and rural development. 
I primarily use laboratory and field experiments. 

In my previous role, I was a research scientist at 
The Center of Excellence for Interdisciplinary and Sustainability Science (CEISS) Universitas Hasanuddin. I am a member of the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD). 
I worked on a variety of projects. 
I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Currently, I worked using R-stats and 
I believe that natural language processing has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. 
I am excited to continue my research and make a positive impact on the world.

I received my Master's in Rural Development from Ehime University in September 2019.
